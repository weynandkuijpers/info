- Its from this Robot that the user gives all instructions.

## Trading Robot

- Does trading for a user e.g. buying/selling/exchanging Digital currencies.
- Is online during the time that trading needs to happen.

## IT Robot

- is where all the IT workloads are being provisioned
- is always online, belongs to the user
- will ask Farming Robot for IT Capacity resource (by means of Reservations)
- the Node robot will confirm directly to the IT Robot about how to access that IT Capacity, so the Farming Pool Robot has no access to the IT resource.
