## ThreeFold Token?  What is it?

A ThreeFold Token is a smart contract digital token that is the exclusive payment instrument or currency for which farmers can sell Internet IT capacity via TF Directory service.   

The primary goals of ThreeFold is to migrate our Token firmly into the mainstream as a payment mechanism used to purchase IT and other services.  To do this, the Foundation prioritizes the Token’s liquidity, stability, transparency and exchangeability - as these metrics heavily influence acceptance and demand for digital (and fiat) currencies.

We designed our Token as a scalable currency with real utility.  The Token Holders benefit from the following:

* Real Utility.  From inception, the Tokens have a specific designated use as the payment mechanism for buying and selling Internet IT capacity on our Grid.  The Token’s utility - in particular its use by IT companies and other buyers of capacity who are not traditional digital coin investors - facilitates liquidity by supporting daily trading volumes and exchangeability
* Neutrality.  ThreeFold is mission- and value-based, has no shareholders and is not owned or controlled by any institution or government.  
* Green.  Our blockchain is different - and enables much greater scalability to millions  of transactions without requiring outsize energy consumption
* Security.  Also TF blockchain is less vulnerable to large miner consortia controlling hashrates or DDOS and other attacks.  All users and nodes are registered on our blockchain-based identity management platform enhancing security and privacy.


### Real Utility - TF Tokens Are Designated Payment Mechanism for Internet IT capacity

What does it mean that the ThreeFold Token has a specific “utility?”  It means that the TF Token has a designated “use” as the exclusive currency for buying and selling Internet capacity via the TF Directory.  Commercial utility is critical long term for a currency.  Over time, the ThreeFold’s objective is for the TF Token to become the preferred currency for Internet IT capacity transactions - scaling with the growth of the Internet.

This utility creates benefits for Token Holders.  Because purchasers of Internet IT capacity are not in the business of investing in digital coins - and they need to use the TF Tokens to pay for their Internet IT capacity - this results in additional transaction activity, higher  daily trading volumes and better liquidity / exchangeability for Token Holders.

Furthermore, Internet capacity is among the fastest growing commodities in the world - and linking the Token directly to the value of Internet IT capacity provides further support and stability for the Token.
